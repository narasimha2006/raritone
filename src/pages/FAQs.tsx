      question: "How does the AI body scan work?",
      answer: "Our AI body scan uses your device's camera to capture your measurements in real-time. The technology analyzes your body shape and provides accurate size recommendations for each product. Your scan data is processed locally and never stored on our servers."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my body scan data secure?",
      answer: "Yes, absolutely. Your body scan data is processed locally on your device and is never stored or shared. We prioritize your privacy and only use the measurements to provide accurate size recommendations."
    },
    {
      question: "What if the recommended size doesn't fit?",
      answer: "We offer free size exchanges within 30 days. If our AI recommendation doesn't fit perfectly, simply return the item and we'll send you the correct size at no additional cost."
    },
    {

    },
    {
      question: "Can I return items without the original packaging?",
      answer: "Items must be returned in their original packaging with all tags attached. This helps us maintain quality standards and ensures the item can be resold."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I track my order?",
      answer: "Once your order ships, you'll receive a tracking number via email and SMS. You can track your package in real-time through our website or the courier partner's portal."
